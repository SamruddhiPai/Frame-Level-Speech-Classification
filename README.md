# Frame-Level-Speech-Classification
Given the mel-spectrogram of audio utterances and 71 phoneme labels, generate predictions of the phonemes for an audio frame. Dataset was derived from articles published in Wall Street Journel.

The 'phoneme_geranation.ipynb' file contains the code. Deep neural network model was implemented for phoneme generation task. The main aim was to explore effect of various hyper-parameters like batch size, number of hidden layers, context size, learning rate, etc.
